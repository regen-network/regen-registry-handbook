# Governance Proposal

Regen Registry is operated by Regen Network Development, Inc (RND), a private for-profit company. Regen Ledger is a public decentralized ledger that is not owned by a single entity (including RND) and is a Digital Commons that is operated by a network of independent stakeholders called Validators that are incentivized to maintain the integrity of the underlying ecological data and credits tracked on the ledger. Regen Network believes this is the best way to maintain long term data integrity, auditability, transparency, and viability, and enables a just allocation of resources and sustained regeneration of ecological ecosystems (see blog post for more details).

Regen Registry is committed to fully comply with all relevant U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) standards and regulations.

Regen Registry is built on the principles of accuracy, transparency, collaboration, accountability, user centric design, responsiveness, and participation. This is applied to Credit Class and Methodology design, provision of monitoring and verification services, integration with other registries, and with 3rd-party service providers.

Regen Registry relies on a software implementation that includes two layers:&#x20;

* Regen Registry Platform - a centralized software layer that provides user accounts, project pages, administrative functions for credit design and issuance.
* Regen Ledger - a decentralized software layer that is used to issue, transfer, and retire credits and tracks all pertinent monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) information as immutable records.

At present, members of the RND team are still the primary contributors to the development of the Registry Program.  Our goal is to have Regen Registry be built and run by a community of experts, including, but not limited to the RND team. With this in mind, our team is working hard to engage our growing network of land stewards, scientists, project, and methodology developers in contributing to the design of the Registry Registry such that it is built by a diverse set of stakeholders and not by a handful of individuals.

While we await interfaces to make Regen Ledger more accessible to the broader community, RND plans to use this address to take on much of the credit class creation, administration, and issuance. However, in the coming months we hope to train others to take on these important tasks such that we can shift credit class administration and issuance to our partners and community members. In addition, our team plans to develop user-facing interfaces and other coordination tools like the group module and multi-signature and "DAO" software which will support decentralized governance of the Registry.

It is our hope that over the next six months we can successfully decentralize this address to support other's ability to create credit classes on Regen Ledger. In doing so, we hope to explore the possibility of transitioning this address into a community-governed meta-registry address which will enable organizations like Verra, Gold Standard, and American Carbon Registry to create credit classes and issue credits without going through a governance proposal.

In the event that RND dissolves, the Regen Registryâ€™s contractual agreements bind both project developers and buyers to uphold any outstanding contractual commitments as if the two slides are direct parties to the contracts.
