# Regen Registry Scope

Regen Registry was developed to be a catalyst for ecosystem regeneration around the globe using blockchain, decentralized finance, and other Web 3.0 tools. To accomplish this, we are developing innovative ways to financially support people working to improve and maintain ecosystem health through the use of nature-based solutions (NbS). We follow a definition of NbS that is similar to the [International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)](https://www.iucn.org) definition but we replace “sustainably” with “regeneratively” to define NbS as:

> “actions to protect, regeneratively manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits”.

This definition includes, but is not limited to, projects reducing negative direct impacts that humans have on ecosystem function, improving climate adaptation, and reducing global warming. Examples of projects that we support will be reflected in our growing list of methodologies.

Regen Registry is focused exclusively on NbS. Other activities, for instance focused on sustainable energy or energy savings, transportation, industrial process, and construction, while undoubtedly important, are not the current focus of our program.
