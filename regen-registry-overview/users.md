**Credit Class Issuers** - The individual or organization with the authority to issue Credit Batches under the given Credit Class. The list of Credit Class Issuers is defined at the time the Credit Class is created and only the admin can update the list after the Credit Class is created.&#x20;

**Credit Designer** - An individual or organization that is developing a new Credit Class or contributing to an existing one.&#x20;

**Earth Steward** - The individual or organization implementing the regenerative practice or Earth management intervention defined in the approved Credit Class & methodology. This can be a farmer, rancher, conservationist, forester, fisherman, etc.&#x20;

**Land Owner** - The individual or organization that holds title to the land where the project is occurring. This can be the Earth Steward or a third party that rents the land to the Earth Steward.&#x20;

**Methodology Developer** - An individual or organization that is developing a new methodology or contributing to an existing one.&#x20;

**Monitor** - An individual or organization contracted to provide monitoring services to measure the ecological benefits / indicators defined in a given Credit Class and its approved methodology.&#x20;

**Project Proponent** - The Land Owner, Project Developer, or Earth Steward registering a project on Regen Registry, that holds responsibility for managing the project. This is also the individual contractually signing off on the Project Plan. Project Proponents include but are not limited to entities that can demonstrate Project ownership. For the avoidance of doubt where an individual executes this representation in their capacity as an authorized office holder of the organization who is the project proponent, this representation is made by the organization.

### Credit Definitions&#x20;

**Credit** - Credits are issued in Credit Batches in either a tradable or retired state. The owner of tradable credits can send, retire, or cancel the credits at any time. Tradable credits are only fungible with credits from the same credit batch. Retiring a credit implies the owner of the credit is consuming it as an offset. Retiring a credit is permanent. Canceled credits are credits that have moved to another registry.&#x20;

**Credit Batch** - All credits are issued in discrete batches by Credit Issuers. A Credit Batch refers to a batch of credits issued at a single point in time for a given Credit Class and project. Each credit batch has a unique ID (i.e. denomination) that starts with the abbreviation of the credit type followed by the start date, end date, and batch sequence number. Each Credit Batch is associated with an on-chain project, linking information about the on-the-ground project implementing the methodologies defined within the Credit Class. Additional information about a Credit Batch can be attached to the metadata field. When credits are issued, they can be issued in a tradable or retired state. The Credit Batch also tracks the total number of active credits (tradable and retired credits) and the total number of canceled credits.&#x20;

**Credit Broker** - An organization or individual who is brokering and completing the documentation and invoicing for a Credit Transaction on behalf of themselves or a Project Proponent.&#x20;

**Credit Buyer or Buyer** - An organization or individual who is purchasing a credit from the Credit Broker or Project Proponent.&#x20;

**Credit Class** - The structure, procedures and requirements for project registration, the quantification, monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV), and issuance of credits related to a certain credit type.&#x20;

**Credit Designer** - An individual or organization that is developing a new Credit Class or updating an existing one.&#x20;

### Methodology Definitions&#x20;

**Beta Form** - A methodology that has not undergone Expert Peer Review&#x20;

**Co-Benefit** - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines co-benefits of climate change mitigation as the positive benefits related to the reduction of greenhouse gasses. We define it more broadly as a benefit that is achieved along with the main indicator tracked and promoted in a given credit - which need not be a reduction of GHG. For example, a biodiversity credit might mainly promote the protection of a certain species and at the same time offer co-benefits, such as protection of water resources.&#x20;

**Methodology** - The method by which ecological outcomes are monitored and measured.&#x20;

**Methodology Developer** - An individual or organization that is developing a new methodology or updating an existing one.

### Monitoring, Reporting, Verification Definitions&#x20;

**Baseline** - An estimate of the measurement of a certain benefit / indicator tracked in a given credit had the project not been implemented. A baseline can be static, dynamic, project specific or based on performance standards (or a combination of those).&#x20;

**Baseline Report** - The report that summarizes the outcomes of the Baseline.&#x20;

**Monitoring** - Measurement of an ecological indicator(s), following the guidelines of a given methodology. Measurements can use various approaches, for instance remote sensing using satellite imagery or estimation using biogeochemical methods.&#x20;

**Monitoring Report** - The report that summaries the outcomes of the Monitoring Round.&#x20;

**Monitoring Round** - A scheduled time following the methodology guidelines in which a monitor performs the measurement or estimation of an ecological indicator(s).&#x20;

**Monitoring Service Provider**- An individual or organization that is contracted to measure the benefits/indicators in a given Credit Class based on the requirements of the approved methodology.&#x20;

**Project Initial Monitoring Date** - The date when the baseline measurement was performed. Verification - A systematic, independent, and documented assessment by a qualified and impartial third party to the benefits assertions for a specific reporting period.&#x20;
