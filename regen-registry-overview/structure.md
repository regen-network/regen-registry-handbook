# Structure

The Regen Registry can be divided into three main sections:

* The [Regen Ledger](https://docs.regen.network/) is the underlying blockchain infrastructure that stores all information related to claims made on ecological state to provide an open and audible trail for assets issued on our platform.
* The [Regen Registry App](https://registry.regen.network/) is a front-end application which allows stakeholders to use Regen Ledger to register projects, buy and sell credits on an open marketplace, and engage in network governance.
* The [Regen Registry Guide](https://app.gitbook.com/o/HLlZLPGRtuSIEfuq1a8I/s/Ws38YRExASMl7tOmp6pp/) outlines the processes by which different stakeholders can engage in the creation of new methodologies and programs used to develop projects and issue credits using features provided by the Regen Registry App.
