# Rules and Regulations

**Approved Methodology**&#x20;

Each Credit Class shall define the Approved Methodology(s) which the credit relies upon.&#x20;

**Project Ownership Project**&#x20;

Proponent shall stipulate the ownership of credits issued to the project. Regen Registry supports fractional ownership of the credits allocated to a project in a given issuance event, therefore credits can be split between Land Stewards, Land Owners, Project Developers, and Buyers.

**Project Registration Date**&#x20;

The Project Registration Date is the date the Project has been approved by Regen Registry. The Crediting Term officially begins on this date. If an Adoption Date precedes the Project Registration Date, the Crediting Term will commence at the Project Initial Monitoring Date as defined by the Approved Methodology.

**Project Renewal**

At the end of the project, the Project Proponent can elect to renew the project. The Project Proponent may do so by: Choosing from these renewal period options: 5, 10, 15 or 20 years. Submitting an updated Project Plan in compliance with up-to-date Credit Class and Approved Methodology. The final project monitoring and verification round of carbon stock and/or other ecological indicator estimates will be automatically used as the renewal up-to-date baseline. Project Proponents may renew a project multiple times. Regen Registry does not limit the number of periods of renewal that are allowed for a given project renewals.

**Project Monitoring Reports**

Project Monitoring Reports shall be completed for each monitoring period following the template for Project Monitoring Report. The Monitor shall submit the report to Regen Registry including any corrections/revisions identified by the verifier (if applicable).&#x20;

The Monitoring Report shall describe the current status of project operation, and include the data monitored, the monitoring plan, the calculated emission reductions and ecological indicators for the reporting period stated in the Credit Class and following the guidelines in the Approved Methodology.

**Project Termination**

* End of Project Termination&#x20;
  * At the end of the Crediting Term, the Project Proponent will engage in a final project verification. The report will be made public on Regen Registry.&#x20;
  * The Project Proponent has the choice to renew the project (renewal duration stipulated in Credit class). In the case of a GHG removal credit, based on the end of project carbon stock estimation, Regen Registry will retire or issue credits from the Buffer Pool. See the Buffer Pool section for more details.

**Premature Termination**&#x20;

[Regen Registry Terms of Service, Section 51](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGvPI5NjsS4WhMCL3AyRa0oHP6j2R34YByNVRo8XDkA/edit#heading=h.yce1cz48gew1)

**Project On Hold**

* A project may be put on hold if:&#x20;
  * Project Proponent fails to comply with the reporting requirements stated in Credit Class and the Approved Methodology.&#x20;
  * A Verification Report is submitted with a Rejection rating.&#x20;
  * In the case of a GHG removal credit, an intentional reversal of carbon stock is identified.&#x20;
* A project in on hold status will not be issued credits until the identified issues are resolved.
* The Project Proponent will be allowed 60 days to remedy the fault found or the project will be deemed non-compliant. Regen Registry may require an additional monitoring and verification round after the fault has been remedied.

**Non-Compliant Projects**

* Projects that are non-compliant include the following cases:&#x20;
  * In the event that a project was put on-hold and the Project Proponent did not comply with Regen Registry requests within sixty days.&#x20;
  * The Project Proponent cancelled the project prematurely and did not comply with final monitoring and verification round requirements. &#x20;

These cases will be seen as a breach of contract, subject to dispute resolution as stipulated in the legal contracts. If the dispute is not resolved, the project will be cancelled from the registry and all issued credits remaining in Project Proponent’s account along with the project credits allocated to Buffer Pool and Permanence Reversal Buffer (if applicable) will be cancelled.

Non-compliant projects will be delisted from Regen Registry and, depending on the case, at RND discretion, the Project Proponent might be restricted from listing any future projects on Regen Registry.

**Retiring Credits**&#x20;

In the case of a GHG removal credit:

* Traditionally in carbon markets, credit retirement involves allowances from regulated emission trading schemes as a method for offsetting carbon emissions. Regen Registry is not a regulated emission trading scheme, but instead provides buyers a way to voluntarily offset their carbon footprint.&#x20;
* Credits can only be retired once. Once a credit has been retired, it cannot be transferred or sold anymore.&#x20;
* Regen Registry provides the ability for buyers to trade their credits, i.e. sell them to other buyers on a secondary market. In the future, a secondary marketplace functionality will be added.&#x20;
* Credit buyers will have access to the Project Proponent’s information, the project location, monitoring reports, and other pertinent data which is made publicly available on Regen Registry. Buyers must indicate the owner of the beneficial interest in the GHG mitigation claim for each credit they retire.

**Tradability**&#x20;

Credit buyers will have the option to sell their credits so long as they have not yet been retired. Credits are treated as commodities, not as securities. RND is committed to comply with all relevant regulatory frameworks, both in the US and internationally. In the future, additional functionality to support secondary market trading will be added.

**Personal / Commercially Sensitive Information**&#x20;

Project Proponents may request to designate portions of the Project Plan or project documentation as Personal / Commercially Sensitive Information. This information must be available for review by Regen Registry and the approved Verifier (with non-disclosure agreements, as necessary), but will not be posted publicly as part of the project documentation on Regen Registry. This information will be restricted to these Project Plan items:&#x20;

* Entity name and contact information&#x20;
* Land tenure&#x20;
* Land ownership type&#x20;

To promote transparency, Regen Registry shall presume by default all project information to be available for public scrutiny, unless requested otherwise by the Project Proponent.

**Previous Rejection by Other Registry**&#x20;

Regen Registry may consider a project rejected by other registries, due to procedural or eligibility requirements, if the project complies with the Credit Class and Approved Methodology. The Project Proponent for such a project shall include a statement in the Project Plan that lists all other programs to which the Project Proponent has applied for registration and was rejected, the reason(s) for the rejection, and pertinent documentation.

**Managing Property Under Covenance Obligation**

Project Proponents that choose to put their land under permanence convenance are required to inform prospective buyers of any permanence obligations associated with the land when selling their property.
