# Project Lifecycle

Account Creation - Project Proponent provides contact information and creates an account on Regen Registry.&#x20;

Project Summary: Project Proponent creates a project, applies for a credit, completes the Project Plan if using an existing methodology, and signs the corresponding legal agreements.&#x20;

Concept Note: A concept note is a short proposal of an idea for a project or methodology which could be used to address environmental and societal challenges and provide human well-being and ecological benefits. Concept notes should be used if there is not already an existing methodology or project development process in place.&#x20;

Submission Review - Regen Registry reviews the submission for completeness and compatibility with the Credit Class and Approved Methodology, and requests additional information as needed.\


Option to submit for Public Comment - Project is posted for a 30 day public comment period. Comments are addressed as agreed upon between the methodology developer and the community.&#x20;

Option to submit for Peer Review - Project is submitted for scientific Peer Review. Comments are addressed as agreed upon between the methodology developer and reviewers.&#x20;

Project Registration - If everything is in order, the project is approved, the contract is signed between the Project Proponent and Regen Registry.&#x20;

Baseline Measurement - Project Proponent engages with Monitor and provides the project information as defined in the Approved Methodology. The Monitor follows the guidelines in the Approved Methodology and generates a baseline measurement of the ecological indicators and benefit assessment assigned to the Credit Class. The Baseline Monitoring Report is submitted to Regen Registry. If the report is approved, it is made publicly available on Regen Registry.&#x20;

Verification - Per the verification schedule defined in the Credit Class, the Project Proponent engages with an independent, approved Verifier to verify the inputs provided by the Project Proponent and the baseline and monitoring reports submitted by the Monitor follow the specification of the Approved Methodology. Fees for verification are determined by the Project Proponent and Verifier. The Verifier submits to Regen Registry a verified Project Plan, verified monitoring report(s), and verification report with verification rating (see Verification section for further details).&#x20;

Verification Acceptance - Based on the verification report rating, Regen Registry issues credits to the Project Proponent. The verification report is made publicly available on Regen Registry.\


Subsequent Monitoring and Verification rounds - Following the guidelines in the Approved Methodology and Credit Class, subsequent monitoring and verification rounds are performed, and the above steps repeat for each credit vintage issuance.&#x20;

Issuance - Regen Registry issues to the Project Proponent’s account credits for the relevant reporting period, in the amount listed in the monitoring report.&#x20;

Transfer or Retire - At the Project Proponent’s discretion, they can sell or retire the credits.&#x20;

Final Project Verification - At the end of the Crediting Term, the Project Proponent will engage in a final project verification. The report will be made public on Regen Registry.&#x20;

Project Renewal (optional) - After the final project verification, the Project Proponent can elect to renew the project. The duration for renewal is defined by each Credit Class.&#x20;

GHG removal projects’ specific adaptations:&#x20;

Credit issuance - With each issuance, a percentage of credits, as defined in the Credit Class, is deposited into the Buffer Pool.&#x20;

Buffer Pool Reconciliation - Based on the end-of-project carbon stock estimation, Regen Registry will retire or transfer credits from the Buffer Pool. See the Buffer Pool section.&#x20;

Permanence Monitoring and Verification - At the end of the permanence period, the Project Proponent will conduct a permanence monitoring and verification round (desk review) in order to verify retention of GHG removed during the project.
