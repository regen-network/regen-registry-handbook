# Guiding Principles List

**Accuracy**&#x20;

The Project Proponent shall reduce, as far as is practical, uncertainties related to the quantification of GHG removals and/or any other applicable ecological indicator, such as species habitat, tree coverage, etc. Methodologies submitted for Regen Registry approval shall include methods for estimating the uncertainty for each indicator. If the width of the 90% confidence interval exceeds 20%, an appropriate confidence deduction shall be applied. The use of models, such as biogeochemical models, must include an estimate of structural uncertainty related to the inadequacy of the model, model bias, and model discrepancy. Monitors shall quantify these using the best available science, Monte Carlo analyses, uncertainty estimates from peer reviewed literature, and/or consulting model experts who have either developed or worked directly with the model in an academic setting.

**Transparency**

Regen Registry strives to create integrity and values through transparency. Transparency of methodology used and verification also benefits our community at large by offering models for other to engage.

Regen Registry is built to provide stakeholders, including Project Proponents, Buyers, scientists, and market experts, with a high level of transparency. We achieve this by:&#x20;

* Credit Classes and Methodologies are publicly available and receive public comment. We also encourage engaging a broad set of subject matter experts during the design process.
* All pertinent project data is publicly available, including the Project Plan, monitoring reports, credit issuance certification, and verification reports.&#x20;
* Regen Ledger will provide an immutable record and digital audit trail of monitoring and verification outcomes, and credit issuance and sales.&#x20;

**Collaboration**

Regen Registry believes deeply in collaboration. We are convening a broad set of independent parties to participate in:&#x20;

* Methodology development and Credit Class design - scientists, economists, land stewards, ecological practitioners, indigenous practitioners and subject matter experts are invited to create new, cutting-edge ecological assets, to provide feedback, and to govern the library of methodologies and credit classes.&#x20;
* Monitoring and verification - remote sensing companies, experts, IoT providers, surveying tools, etc. are invited to provide their monitoring services to streamline the costs of MRV while maintaining scientific rigor.&#x20;
* Regen Registry platform and Regen Ledger development - software developers who are eager to mitigate climate change are welcome to contribute to these open source projects.

**Practicality**

Regen Registry aims to balance the time and cost required by Project Proponents to collect data for monitoring, verification and reporting and the need for assurances from Credit Buyers. To that end, Regen Registry encourages a transparent and tiered approach to methodology development that will provide different levels of assurances to cater to different needs of Credit Buyers.

Security RND will conduct security audits of its software, including Regen Ledger and Regen Registry, to ensure the data integrity and fidelity of credit ownership and the underlying MRV data.

Open Source and Open Data Following the collaboration principle above, RND is a strong proponent of open-source software and open data. We firmly believe that in order to achieve the best results, provide transparency, ensure fair governance, and invite collaboration from multiple stakeholders, we need to develop open source software and share our research data openly. Our software code repositories are available on GitHub

User-Centric Design Relative to their potential, Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) carbon credits have seen limited adoption in regulatory and voluntary markets. Historically, the supply of these credits has been limited because credit design has not incorporated enough feedback from land stewards, resulting in credit requirements that were complicated, expensive and/or time consuming. Regen Registry follows a user centric design of credit classes and methodologies with input not only from buyers but also land stewards and project developers.
