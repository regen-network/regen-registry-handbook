# Credit Issuance

### **Project Lifecycle**&#x20;

**Project Credits**&#x20;

The project proponent stipulates the ownership of credits issued to the project. Regen Registry supports fractional ownership of the credits allocated to a project in a given issuance event, therefore credits can be split between Earth stewards, land owners, project developers, and buyers. The crediting term officially begins on the project registration date, the date when the project has been approved by Regen Registry. If an adoption date (date when new practices were implemented) precedes the project registration date, the crediting term will commence at the project initial monitoring date (or baseline) as defined by the approved credit class.&#x20;

1. **Retiring Credits:** Traditionally in carbon markets, credit retirement involves allowances from regulated emission trading schemes as a method for offsetting carbon emissions. Regen Registry is not a regulated emission trading scheme because Regen provides buyers with a way to voluntarily offset their carbon footprint. Credits can only be retired once. Once a credit has been retired, it cannot be transferred or sold anymore. Regen Registry provides the ability for buyers to trade their credits, i.e. sell them to other buyers on a secondary market. In the future, a secondary marketplace functionality will be added. Credit buyers will have access to the project proponent’s information, the project location, monitoring reports, and other pertinent data which is made publicly available on Regen Registry. Buyers must indicate the owner of the beneficial interest in the GHG mitigation claim for each credit they retire.&#x20;
2. **Tradability:** Credit buyers will have the option to sell their credits so long as they have not yet been retired. Credits are treated as commodities, not as securities. Regen Registry is committed to comply with all relevant regulatory frameworks, both in the US and internationally. In the future, additional functionality to support secondary market trading will be added. Aggregate project proponents may be able to create efficiencies around reporting and verification by strategically combining a group of project areas participating in an&#x20;
3. **Aggregate Projects:** Project areas should be grouped so their defining characteristics are as homogeneous as possible. Verifiers may select randomly which project areas will receive on-site visits, or apply a risk analysis to identify project areas with the strongest influence over an aggregate project’s outcomes. Verifiers can use their own discretion to determine the data sampling approach, yet all sites require at least a desk-based review. Sites must have similar soil types and be located within the same pre-defined geographic region, following the ecosystem types as outlined in the taxonomy document. At the end of the crediting term, the project proponent will engage in a final project verification. The report will be made public on Regen Registry. The project proponent has the choice to renew the project (renewal duration stipulated in credit class).&#x20;
4. **Project Renewal:** Submitting an updated project plan in compliance with up-to-date credit class and approved methodology. The final project monitoring and verification round of carbon stock and/or other ecological indicator estimates will be automatically used as the renewal up-to-date baseline. Project proponents may renew a project multiple times. Regen Registry does not limit the number of periods of renewal that are allowed for a given project.
5. **Project Compliance:** Project compliance stipulations are outlined in the approved credit class. The following cases apply to any relevant credit class in Regen Registry:

* Project proponents that choose to put their land under permanence convenance are required to inform prospective buyers of any permanence obligations associated with the land when selling their property.
* Previous rejection by other registry&#x20;
  * Regen Registry may consider a project rejected by other registries, due to procedural or eligibility requirements, if the project complies with the credit class and approved methodology. The project proponent for such a project shall include a statement in the project plan that lists all other programs to which the project proponent has applied for registration and was rejected, the reason(s) for the rejection, and pertinent documentation.
*   A project may be placed on hold under the following circumstances:

    * Project proponent fails to comply with the reporting requirements stated in credit class and the approved methodology.&#x20;
    * A verification report is submitted with a rejection rating.&#x20;
    * In the case of a GHG removal credit, an intentional reversal of carbon stock is identified.&#x20;
    * Other violations of requirements outlined in approved methodology and credit class&#x20;


* Projects that are non-compliant include the following cases:&#x20;
  * Regen Registry may consider a project rejected by other registries, due to procedural or eligibility requirements, if the project complies with the credit class and approved methodology. The project proponent for such a project shall include a statement in the project plan that lists all other programs to which the project proponent has applied for registration and was rejected, the reason(s) for the rejection, and pertinent documentation.&#x20;
  * These cases will be seen as a breach of contract, subject to dispute resolution as stipulated in the legal contracts. If the dispute is not resolved, the project will be canceled from the Regen Registry and all issued credits remaining in the project proponent’s account along with the project credits allocated to buffer pool and permanence reversal buffer (if applicable) will be canceled.&#x20;
  * Non-compliant projects will be delisted from Regen Registry and, depending on the case, at RND discretion, the project proponent might be restricted from listing any future projects on Regen Registry.
