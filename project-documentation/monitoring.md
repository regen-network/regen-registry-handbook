# Monitoring

Regen Registry is establishing an ecosystem of Monitors to provide monitoring services following the guidelines in the Program Guideâ€™s Monitoring section.

Once the approval process of the Credit Class and Methodology has been completed, Methodology Developers are required to identify and train at least one Monitor - whether from the existing approved ones or a new one - to provide monitoring services based on the new methodology.

Note, a Methodology Developer can also act as a Monitor so long as there is no conflict of interest with the Project Proponent.
