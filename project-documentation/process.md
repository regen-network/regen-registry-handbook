# Process

Once the approval process of the Credit Class and Methodology has been completed, Credit Designers and Methodology Developers shall define the accompanying documentation needed in order to register projects, and conduct monitoring and verification:&#x20;

**Project Plan Supplement**&#x20;

Each Project Proponent registering a project is required to submit a Project Plan with the key information pertaining to the Credit Class and Approved Methodology. While Regen Registry offers a generic Project Plan template, it requires an adaptation per Credit Class (and approved methodology). Therefore, Credit Designers shall define a dedicated Project Plan supplement for the given Credit Class and approved methodology.&#x20;

**Project Monitoring Templates**&#x20;

In order to conduct baseline and on-going monitoring measurements, each Project Proponent is required to submit monitoring data. While Regen Registry offers a generic Monitoring Information template, it requires an adaptation per approved methodology. Therefore, Credit Designers shall define the dedicated monitoring templates for the given Credit Class and approved methodology.&#x20;

**Project Verification Templates** (if applicable)&#x20;

In order to conduct the independent verification process, each Project Proponent is required to submit verification data. While Regen Registry offers a generic Verification template, it requires an adaptation per approved methodology. Therefore, Credit Designers shall define the dedicated verification templates for the given Credit Class and approved methodology. Note, verification is optional for Flex Credits.&#x20;

**Pro-forma** (optional ; recommended)&#x20;

In order to inform other project developers about the economics and return on investment of projects applying for the new credit and methodology, each Project Proponent will create a pro-forma including the monitoring and verification costs based on the initial monitors and verifiers recruited for the new credit and methodology. Regen Registry offers a generic pro-forma template that can be adapted as needed.
