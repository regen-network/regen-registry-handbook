# Project on Hold

A project may be put on hold if:&#x20;

* Project Proponent fails to comply with the reporting requirements stated in Credit Class and the Approved Methodology.
* A Verification Report is submitted with a Rejection rating.&#x20;
* In the case of a GHG removal credit, an intentional reversal of carbon stock is identified.&#x20;

A project in on hold status will not be issued credits until the identified issues are resolved.&#x20;

The Project Proponent will be allowed 60 days to remedy the fault found or the project will be deemed non-compliant. Regen Registry may require an additional monitoring and verification round after the fault has been remedied.
