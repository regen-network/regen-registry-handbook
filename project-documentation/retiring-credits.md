# Retiring Credits

In the case of a GHG removal credit:

* Traditionally in carbon markets, credit retirement involves allowances from regulated emission trading schemes as a method for offsetting carbon emissions. Regen Registry is not a regulated emission trading scheme, but instead provides buyers a way to voluntarily offset their carbon footprint.&#x20;
* Credits can only be retired once. Once a credit has been retired, it cannot be transferred or sold anymore.&#x20;
* Regen Registry provides the ability for buyers to trade their credits, i.e. sell them to other buyers on a secondary market. In the future, a secondary marketplace functionality will be added.&#x20;
* Credit buyers will have access to the Project Proponentâ€™s information, the project location, monitoring reports, and other pertinent data which is made publicly available on Regen Registry. Buyers must indicate the owner of the beneficial interest in the GHG mitigation claim for each credit they retire.
