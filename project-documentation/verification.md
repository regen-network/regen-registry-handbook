# Verification

Regen Registry is establishing an ecosystem of Verifiers to provide independent verification services following the guidelines in the Program Guideâ€™s Monitoring section.

Once the approval process of the Credit Class and Methodology has been completed, Credit Designers are required to identify and train at least one Verifier - whether from the existing approved ones or a new one - to provide verification services based on the new Credit Class and Methodology.

Note, this is required only for Credit Classes that include independent verification.
