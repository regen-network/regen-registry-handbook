# Personal / Commercially Sensitive Information

Project Proponents may request to designate portions of the Project Plan or project documentation as Personal / Commercially Sensitive Information. This information must be available for review by Regen Registry and the approved Verifier (with non-disclosure agreements, as necessary), but will not be posted publicly as part of the project documentation on Regen Registry. This information will be restricted to these Project Plan items:&#x20;

* Entity name and contact information&#x20;
* Land tenure&#x20;
* Land ownership type

To promote transparency, Regen Registry shall presume by default all project information to be available for public scrutiny, unless requested otherwise by the Project Proponent.
