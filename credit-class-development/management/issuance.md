# Issuance

The credit protocol issuers are the addresses with the authority to issue credit batches in a given credit protocol. The list of credit protocol issuers is defined at the time the credit protocol is created and only the admin can update the list after the credit protocol is created.

Ecocredits (i.e. the credits issued under the Regen Registry)  are issued through a batch issuance process where only approved issuers for a given credit protocol can issue credits from that credit protocol. Each credit batch is associated with a project implementing the protocol and are unique in that each credit batch has a start and end date representing the period in which the positive ecological outcomes were measured.

Credits issued within a credit batch are only fungible with credits from the same batch. Credits can be issued in a tradable or retired state. Credits issued in a tradable state can be transferred or retired by the owner. Retiring a credit is permanent and implies the credit is being consumed as an offset.
