# Management

Credit protocols can be created and managed by individuals, groups, or organizations. Each credit protocol also has a credit protocol administrator (credit class admin). The credit class admin is the Regen address with the authority to update a given credit protocol (i.e. to change the admin, the list of approved issuers, and the metadata) and list of approved issuers. When a credit protocol is created, the admin is initially set to the address that created the credit protocol.
