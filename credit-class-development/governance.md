# Governance

In the near future our aim is for a broad set of stakeholders, including subject matter experts, Earth stewards, project developers, monitors, and verifiers to govern protocols, achieving a more independent, decentralized registry inclusive of a broad set of stakeholders.

At present, Regen Registry is the sole credit protocol creator on Regen Ledger.  This involves helping community members create and manage on-chain assets, both for credits produced natively through the Regen Registry Program and for credits from other registries, such as Verra, Gold Standard, or American Carbon Registry.

Regen Registry plans to decentralize this address to support other's ability to create credit protocols on Regen Ledger. In doing so, we will explore transitioning this address into a community-governed meta-registry address. This will enable organizations like Verra, Gold Standard, and American Carbon Registry to create credit protocols and issue credits without going through a governance proposal. The opportunity is still available for community members to apply to be an approved credit protocol creator. The community has the right to revoke Regen Registryâ€™s ability to create credit protocols if it is seen as unsuccessful in the mission to bring Regen Registry, and other registry programs, on chain.

Regen Registry plans to use this address to steward much of the credit protocol processes. In addition, Regen Registry is developing user interfaces and other coordination tools like the group module and multi-signature and "DAO" software to support decentralized governance of the Registry.
