# Who are Expert Peer Reviewers

**Why An Expert Peer Review Is Important**

The peer review process provides valuable feedback for those developing methodologies. It is a method of review that is widely respected and understood and creates value for your project. Overall, the process works to advance the field of nature-based solutions (NBS) by helping to create standards that elevate the value of NbS’s.

**Why it is Important for Experts to Engage in Peer Reviews**

Reviewers benefit by exposure to novel applications in their fields of interest. Tenure committees look favorably on participation in peer review, and invitations to review underscore that the reviewer is a respected subject matter expert. Contacts made during the peer review process can lead to long-lasting collaboration.

Early career researchers (ECRs) could and should also become involved in methodology peer review. Becoming a reviewer early in your career helps you to better appreciate the feedback you receive as an author. A further benefit is it provides training in evaluating research critically. Are their methods suitable? Do their methods seem valid and appropriate for the intended goals? There is a clear reason for ECRs to become reviewers from a personal perspective, but the academic community benefits more widely. ECRs form a significant component of the academic community, and their involvement in peer review spreads out the workload, resulting in a more efficient process.&#x20;

**How to Become a Regen Peer Reviewer**

Are you an expert in a nature-based solutions field, environmental economics, a specific ecological region or greenhouse gas accounting? Would you like to become involved in reviewing novel methodologies?&#x20;

Peer reviewers should have significant expertise and experience with standardized approaches. Methodology developers, policy makers, market analysts and validation/verification bodies, among others, are invited to apply. Familiarity with VCS methodology development and assessment is useful but not essential.

Peer reviewers should expect to commit 4-8 hours to the task.&#x20;
