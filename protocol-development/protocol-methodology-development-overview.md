# Protocol (Methodology) Development Overview

The protocol details the credit type, credit unit, project activities, ecosystem type, monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) process that is specific to a project.&#x20;

As a methodology is being developed, the Regen Registry and Science Teams are available for limited internal feedback as part of teh Protocol Review process that as outlined below. &#x20;

Please also join our [Hylo space](https://www.hylo.com/groups/regen-methodology-development) to engage in community support.  See the [Methodology Development Support](protocol-development-support.md) chapter for more details.

**Protocol Development Process:**&#x20;

The development of a protocol includes:&#x20;

* Research into existing approved methodologies in the [Regen Registry Methodology Library](https://app.gitbook.com/o/HLlZLPGRtuSIEfuq1a8I/s/H1QmzemVpWDCJv0QlPOj/) and those listed on other registries that may be similar, are tested and can be used as models for your methodology.&#x20;

If using a methodology from an outside registry, it is the methodology developers responsibility to contact the author of the methodology to ask for permission to use that methodology. Cited resources and/or first hand interviews and accounts of regenerative work and observed successes from knowledgeable and experienced earth stewards in the projects specified ecosystem outline of researched monitoring approach including monitoring protocols and frequency description of verification process.
