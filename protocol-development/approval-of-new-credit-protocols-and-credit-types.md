# Approval of New Credit Protocols and Credit Types

### Overview

Regen Registry’s governance processes are designed to uphold the principles outlined at the beginning of this Handbook while ensuring decisions are transparent, participatory, and accountable. The goal is not only to confirm the technical rigor of new credit protocols and credit types, but also to align them with Regen’s broader mission of ecological regeneration and public benefit. To achieve this, protocols move through a sequence of expert and public review, community feedback, and on-chain decision-making. This structure ensures that diverse perspectives are heard, that approvals are guided by shared values, and that all outcomes are permanently and transparently recorded on chain.

### Approval of Credit Protocols

After the expert review and public comment period (described in previous chapters) the approval process proceeds:

* **Resolution of Comments**: The methodology developer must address and resolve all expert and public comments.
* **Registry Review**: A designated Registry Agent will review how comments were addressed by developer, and ensure full resolution between comments and responses.
* **Unresolved Issues**: If some comments cannot be resolved, the Regen Registry team will weigh in and make a decision guided by the principles outlined in the Handbook (environmental integrity, mission alignment, technical robustness, feasibility, inclusivity, and public benefit).
* **Final Confirmation**: Once either (a) all comments are resolved, or (b) the Registry team has made a decision on outstanding issues, the protocol can proceed.
* **Notification**: The Registry team notifies the methodology developer of the approval decision.
* **On-Chain Record**: The Regen Registry team will create a proposal in the DAODAO Regen Registry and vote to approve the protocol. This ensures a transparent and permanent log of all approved protocols (beginning fall 2025).

### Approval of New Credit Types

If the credit protocol involves a new credit type, the new credit type must go through a governance process for acceptance.&#x20;

* **Credit Protocols vs. Credit Types**: Most new methodologies are approved as credit protocols. However, if the proposal establishes an entirely new **credit type** (e.g biodiversity credits vs. carbon credits), it requires broader governance
* **Governance Pathway**:
  1. **Forum Proposal**: The proposer must first introduce the credit type concept in the [Regen Forum.](https://forum.regen.network) This creates an open space for community members, stakeholders, and experts to review and provide feedback.
  2. **Feedback Period**: A minimum **two-week period** is required for discussion, refinement, and feedback from the community before advancing to a formal vote. This ensures transparency and broad input.
  3. **Governance Vote**: After the feedback window closes, the proposal can be submitted as a governance vote. Approval is determined by the Regen community of token holders, following the on-chain governance process.
* **Historical Log**: Approved credit types and the associated decision on acceptance are recorded on chain

**Note**: For step-by-step instructions on submitting governance proposals on chain, see the [Regen Network technical documentation on message-based governance proposals](https://docs.regen.network/tutorials/user/message-based-governance-proposals.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com#introduction).
