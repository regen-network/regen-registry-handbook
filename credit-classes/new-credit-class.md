# New Credit Class

The following process is applied to all new credit classes:

1\) Internal Review

2\) Expert Peer Review

3\) Public Comment



1\. Internal Review: Credit designer submits the proposed new or modified credit class to Regen Registry.  Regen Registry reviews the draft and provides feedback.  Approximately a 4-6 week process.

2\. Expert Peer Review: Draft moves to Expert Peer Review handled by Regen Registry team.  Approximately a 4-6 week process.

Public Comment - The credit class is posted publicly on the Regen Registry Gitbook site for a minimum of 15 days.  At the conclusion of the Public Comment period, the comments are compiled into a report and sent to the credit designer, who then has 30 days to respond to comments in writing and incorporate relevant feedback into a revised version.

Process Documentation -In adherence to our values of the highest level of transparency and integrity of credits, Regen Registry documents the entire credit class approval process including feedback and revisions from Internal Review, Expert Peer Review. This process is then made public as part of the projectâ€™s profile on the Regen Marketplace.



For examples of existing credit classes to provide guidance on how to write a credit class visit the [Regen Registry Library](https://library.regen.network/) and the&#x20;





**If the credit class is tied to a new methodology the credit class and methodology will be required to be submitted at the same time for each step of the review process.**
