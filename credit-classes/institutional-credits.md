# Institutional Credits



Methodologies used within Institutional Credits shall follow the requirements in the Methodology Design How-To guide including:&#x20;

*   Use one of the following quantification approaches:&#x20;

    * Approach 1: In-field measurements and remotely sensed observations are used to quantify change.&#x20;
    * Approach 2: Models and GHG inventory measurement systems based on peer reviewed literature and other regional datasets are used to calculate changes in the chosen indicator. Methods in this approach typically rely on variables highly correlated to the primary indicator, such as climate data, soil or forest inventory data, vegetation data, and land management activity data to create ex-ante estimates.&#x20;
    * Approach 3: This approach follows the stock change factor methods outlined in the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories, but uses regional or site specific stock change factors or sequestration rates to quantify change. These provide a higher temporal and spatial resolution and can be more specific to the activity type than Tier 1 factors.


* Follow frameworks (optional): methodologies are encouraged to follow available Regen Registry methodology frameworks (e.g. Soil Organic Carbon framework).&#x20;
* Adhere to GHG accounting policies:

**A methodology that is not following one of the above approaches shall require an approval from Regen Registry.**
