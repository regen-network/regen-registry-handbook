# Credit Classes

Regen Registry aims to democratize and invigorate the design of ecosystem service credits. To that end we are separating out the typical set of definitions that are part and parcel of most registry standards and allow Credit Designers to modify and upgrade these as needed and appropriate, essentially replacing the top-down approach with a bottom-up one.

Creating a one-size-fits-all solution is suboptimal and does not tap into the overall potential of nature-based solutions. Ecological systems are inherently complex and regenerative farming, grazing ,and conservation practices are often nuanced and locale specific. Similarly, the needs and risk profile of buyers vary substantially depending on the size of the company, its sector, climate goals, etc. Therefore, Credit Designers should carefully examine the needs of both land steward and buyers in a given ecological and best management practice(s) context, and devise a solution that addresses the intersection of those needs. With that said, in an ideal scenario, the Credit Class should address a common use case that will be applicable to many projects and not a very limited set of ones.

Regen Registry focuses exclusively on nature based solutions. Credits aim to incentivize activities that protect, sustainably and/or regeneratively manage, restore natural or modified ecosystems, address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. Other activities, for instance focused on sustainable energy or energy savings, transportation, industrial process, construction, mining and industrial waste management, while undoubtedly important, are not the current focus of our program.
