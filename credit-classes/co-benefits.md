# Co-Benefits

In the spirit of bottom-up development, Credit Designers are encouraged to design and include in the Credit Class the appropriate co-benefits for the given use case. The quantification process for each co-benefit shall be specified in the approved methodology(s). For Institutional Credits, the independent verification of a co-benefit is optional but recommended.

It is highly recommended that the quantification method of a co-benefit follows established and reputable frameworks, methods and standards for the given subject matter. For example animal welfare should follow the applicable national standards in a given country or region. Conducting a peer review process for the quantification method of a co-benefit for Institutional Credits is optional, but recommended.&#x20;
