# Flex Credits

While Institutional Credits meet the needs institutions look for best-in-class offsets, there are situations that merit more flexibility on the GHG accounting requirements, such as corporate insetting, long standing nature based projects, and local / community engagements. For these and other situations, Credit Designers default to using Flex Credits. That is, when a credit does not meet all of the Institutional Credit criteria then it is labeled as a Flex Credit.&#x20;

Methodologies used within Flex Credits are encouraged to follow the same requirements as for Institutional Credit methodologies (see above), but are not required to. In any case, every methodology shall conform to the best practices and rigor from a scientific standpoint as appropriate for the specific situation at hand.&#x20;

A few of the benefits of Flex Credits include:&#x20;

* Provide more flexibility to credit designers in tailoring credits to their needs with fewer limitations on land stewards and project developers.
* Serve to evaluate new nature based approaches, which if proven successful can be later upgraded to Institutional Credits.&#x20;
* Run the full gamut from semi Institutional Credit to a more bespoke design, for example:&#x20;
  * Institutional Credit minus the additionality requirement e.g. Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) in Grasslands credits which can potentially apply to existing farms that have been practicing regenerative grazing for many years.&#x20;
  * Bespoke credit e.g. Soil Organic Carbon in vineyards with sheep grazing that does not satisfy additionality, or provide independent verification. This is more of a local, niche use case for sheep grazing on regenerative vineyards.
