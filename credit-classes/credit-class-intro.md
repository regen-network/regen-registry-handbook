# Credit Class Intro

**Regen Registry aims to support the creation of a broad set of Credit Classes that cover different ecosystems, geographical regions and localities, and are tailored for different stakeholders (e.g. smallholder farmers, corporate farms, indigenous communities, conservation organizations, etc).**

The intent of the Credit Class is to democratize and invigorate the design of ecosystem service credits by allowing for a flexible and modular approach which unites different measurement systems under a shared set of definitions, rules, and requirements. By separating out the methodology from the programmatic requirements of a credit, the Credit Class provides an adaptable solution to building ecosystem service credits by allowing individuals to design ecological assets to fit a specific set of needs.

For Earth Stewards, this means designing credits in a way that is context specific; a bottom up, rather than a top-down solution. While more traditional approaches often rely on a single methodology to define everything from the measurement approach to the project verification and credit issuance requirements, the Credit Class provides the flexibility needed to overcome financial constraints, access to scientific resources, eligibility requirements, and site specific limitations. In this way, the Credit Class offers agency over the credit design process and makes participating in ecosystem service markets much more accessible.

* **Ecosystem Type:** Each Credit Class and Methodology shall stipulate the Ecosystem Type based on RND taxonomy. In the event there is no matching definition in the taxonomy, the Credit Designer or Methodology Developer will propose an addition to the taxonomy.&#x20;
* **Ecosystem Service Classification:** Each Credit Class and Methodology shall stipulate the Ecosystem Service based on RND taxonomy. In the event there is no matching definition in the taxonomy, the Credit Designer or Methodology Developer will propose an addition to the taxonomy.
