# Management

Credit classes can be created and managed by individuals, groups, or organizations. Each credit class also has a credit class administrator (credit class admin). The credit class admin is the Regen address with the authority to update a given credit class (i.e. to change the admin, the list of approved issuers, and the metadata) and list of approved issuers. When a credit class is created, the admin is initially set to the address that created the credit class.
