# Credit Classes

The intent of the credit class is to democratize and invigorate the design of ecosystem service credits by allowing for a flexible and modular approach which unites different measurement systems under a shared set of definitions, rules, and requirements. By separating out the methodology from the programmatic requirements of a credit, the credit class provides an adaptable solution to building ecosystem service credits by allowing individuals to design ecological assets to fit a specific set of needs.

For land stewards, this means designing credits in a way that is context specific; a bottom up, rather than a top-down solution. While more traditional approaches often rely on a single methodology to define everything from the measurement approach to the project verification and credit issuance requirements, the credit class provides the flexibility needed to overcome financial constraints, access to scientific resources, eligibility requirements, and site specific limitations. In this way, the credit class offers agency over the credit design process and makes participating in ecosystem service markets much more accessible.

General guidelines: Each Credit Class shall follow and/or is subject to these generic requirements defined in Program Guide, and shall define the Credit Class specific requirements, as depicted in the table below:&#x20;

Note, in the event, a deviation from the above requirements is needed, an approval from Regen Registry will be necessary.

Depending on the credit type there might be additional requirements.  There are two types of credits on Regen Registry as it relates to carbon credits: Institutional Credits and Flex Credits
