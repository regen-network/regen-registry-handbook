# Project Registration

### Registration Process Overview

This guide outlines the process for project proponents to register a project with the Regen Registry. Regen Registry welcomes a variety of ecological accounting projects. The phases outlined below are designed for GHG emission reduction and/or removal projects but can be adjusted for other types of ecological outcomes.&#x20;

The role of the Regen Registry is to review  the project submission for completeness and compatibility with the credit class and approved methodology. Additional information may be requested as needed. If the project is approved, the contract can be signed between the project proponent and Regen Registry.&#x20;

The Project Registration process includes the following phases:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Project Plan Submission" %}
Each project proponent registering a project must submit a project plan with key information for the credit class and approved methodology. Regen Registry offers a generic [project plan template ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19pYU0N69IDpeav6Hk747l1w0-a5-i53o/view?usp=share\_link)to adapt for each credit class. Please download the [project plan template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p\_HN4Q5vUjp3hni04lLFGYuAUPoB60a9Tc-I6PObZOo/copy) and submit it using the [Project Registration Submission](https://airtable.com/shrYitbUuFQcD8jcT) form. Project proponents may use other templates if the final document demonstrates sufficient information to register a project. &#x20;

As applicable, monitoring reports should be submitted with the project plan. See Regen Registry [Monitoring Report Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zZ1n7mOKKKno2\_1Rj0RR9dPFizEG-F-HrI23Vwutq8E/edit).&#x20;

Project proponents may request to designate portions of the project plan or project  documentation as personal / commercially sensitive information. This information must be available for review by Regen Registry and, if applicable, the approved verifier (with non-disclosure agreements, as necessary), but will not be posted publicly as part of the project documentation on the project page unless specifically allowed. Examples of sensitive information include:

* Entity name and contact information
* Land tenure category (public, private, communal)
* Land ownership type (owner, tenant, trust)
* Established project boundaries

Regen Registry encourages that all or the majority of the information is shared publicly to the extent that is possible for the sake of transparency.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Project Validation" %}
Once the project plan has been submitted, the project will move into project validation to ensure projects:

* Pass project eligibility checks specified in the approved credit class and methodology
* Successfully generate GHG emission removal and/or reductions expected using the models and methods outlined in the project plan.&#x20;

The project validation process consists of these two  steps in this order:

1. Internal Validation&#x20;
2. Third Party Validation

#### Internal Validation

Projects will be reviewed by the Regen Registry using the following criteria:

* Adherence to protocols in approved methodology&#x20;
* Adherence to requirements in credit class, with particular reference to:
  * Project ownership is stipulated in project description for the project proponent to be able to carry out project activities
  * Project ownership validity that provides reasonable assessment of ownership claim by the project proponent to ensure the project proponent can legally carry out project activities. This includes a review of jurisdictional and regulatory conflicts.
* If a GHG Emission reduction and/or removal project as specified by methodology and credit class:
  * Regen Registry can recommend further assessment of projected GHG emissions reduction and/or removal estimates based on models, methodology equations and project-specific contexts

The Regen Registry team may require additional adjustments to the documentation submitted. If so, the project owner must make the changes and resubmit the documents within 10 days of getting our proposed changes.

#### Third Party Validation

In addition to internal validation, project proponents may need third-party validation if required by the credit class. Third-party validations, often by a validation/verification body (VVB), provide extra assurance that a project follows the rules and requirements in the credit class and [Regen Registry Guide: Program Rules and Regulations](https://library.regen.network/v/regen-registry-program-guide/regen-registry-overview/program-rules-and-requirements). Fees for third party validation are decided by the project proponent and the third party.


{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Project Approval" %}
Projects which have passed the project validation phase are eligible to be registered with the Regen Registry. If a project proponent decides to register a project, they must sign necessary contracts, including Terms of Service.&#x20;

Once these activities have been completed, the project will be instantiated on the [Regen Ledger](https://docs.regen.network/) and a corresponding project page will be created on the [Regen Marketplace](https://app.regen.network/).
