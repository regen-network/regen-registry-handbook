# Project Page Template

We ecnourage project developers and proponents to start their Project Page that will appear on our [Marketplace](https://app.regen.network/projects/1) as soon as possible.  Also consider adding [Data Streams](https://guides.regen.network/guides/regen-app-project-developers-and-land-stewards/using-regen-data-stream)  as it is a great way to build awarness and appreciation for your project and give potential buyers a way to track your progress - even well before listing credits.

Visit our [Creating a Project Page](https://guides.regen.network/guides/regen-app-project-developers-and-land-stewards/creating-projects) guide to get started.
