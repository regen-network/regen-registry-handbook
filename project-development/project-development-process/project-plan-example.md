_Project Details_

_Submission Date:_ January 1, 2021&#x20;

Project Title: Farm Land One&#x20;

Credit Class applied: CarbonPlus Grasslands (GHG & Co-Benefits in Grazing Systems Credit Class)&#x20;

Methodology applied: Methodology for GHG and Co-Benefits in Grazing Systems&#x20;

Project Eligibility: The land included within the project boundary corresponds to temperate grasslands under time controlled high density rotational grazing systems, listed within the land management practices in the Credit Class.&#x20;

Singular / Aggregate Project: Singular&#x20;

Credit Ownership: 100% of credits post commissions to be owned by Land Steward.

Project Start Date: 06/01/2021&#x20;

Crediting Term: 06/01/2021 to 06/01/2031&#x20;

Project Location:

Country: USA&#x20;

Region/State/Province: California&#x20;

City/Town/Community: Town A&#x20;

Geolocation link or attach shape files (e.g. kml / kmz / shp / geojson polygons): \[insert GIS location and google map image showing farm location]&#x20;

Project Area:&#x20;

Gross project area (including all structures, etc) in hectares: 1,852&#x20;

Habitat: Dry sclerophyll forest and grassy woodland, primarily consisting of New England Peppermint, Ribbon Gum, Mountain Gum, Snow Gum, Maple that form the open forests and grassy woodlands distributed throughout the property. Saltwood Stream is the main freshwater wetland type that occurs.

Main environmental threats in last few years: drought and fire&#x20;

Land-Use History&#x20;

Regenerative practices: Since 2013 the Farm has been implementing high density time controlled rotational grazing at the property. The program was implemented by 2017. Time controlled rotational grazing optimizes the number of stock in a paddock and matches grazing period with available pasture, in order to mimic natural herding behaviors by having short graze periods at high density followed by long rest periods. This allows the pasture to recover. When managed well, this grazing system increases ground cover, biomass, plant diversity, animal and plant nutrition, soil health, water infiltration, and soil organic carbon.&#x20;

Prior to adopting these regenerative practices: Prior to 2013 a stocking regime was the primary grazing management practice with pasture improvement and a synthetic fertilizer regime.&#x20;

Prior environmental conditions of the project area: The elevation at the Farm is 1200m and mean rainfall of 1200mm per annum. Mean maximum temperature is 21.4C and the mean average minimum temperature is 10.4C. The Farm has approximately 34 frost days/year. Soils are highly fertile volcanic basalt-based soils with the dominant soil type being deep friable clay. Average slope is 3.2%. Grazing pastures are a mixture of ⅓ native and ⅔ exotic. Remnant vegetation consists of approximately 20% forest, 12% sparse woody and 70% grasslands. Surface water amounts to approximately 3.1 ha.&#x20;

Historical Soil Sampling Data (if available and applicable): Soil sampling & the following details have been supplied:&#x20;

GIS shape file with location of samples&#x20;

The soil health assessment contained samples prior to 2017 sampling round which were included as a reference, though not required for monitoring.&#x20;

38 sites were sampled per sampling round&#x20;

Samples were collected down to 15cm in 2017 and 2018.&#x20;

The independent accredited laboratory is Laboratory A at the University of Thinking.&#x20;

All laboratory results provided SOC% from lowest to highest and median.

Stratification and site selection was based on the Regen Network Soil Sample Stratification tool.&#x20;

Additionality Requirements:&#x20;

Project Activity: Increasing soil carbon via the implementation of high-density time controlled rotational grazing.&#x20;

Adoption Date: November 2016&#x20;

Permanence:&#x20;

Specify how permanence is satisfied per the Credit Class stipulations: Permanence Reversal Buffer of 5%&#x20;

Leakage Management: Specify whether the Proposed Activity has a de minimis impact in terms of leakage, or above de minimis: de minimis

Commercially Sensitive Information:&#x20;

Indicate whether any commercially sensitive information should be excluded from the public version of the project documentation which will be made available on Regen Registry, and briefly describe the items to which such information pertains.&#x20;

Sustainable Development**:**

Goal 2: Zero Hunger, promoting sustainable food security and production, reducing water, genetic resources&#x20;

Goal 3: Good health and wellbeing. Produce high-nutrient based food, clean air, positive work environment for employees&#x20;

Goal 4: Quality education. Promote benefits of sustainable food production to broader the community and industry&#x20;

Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation. Promote and support health ecosystem services.&#x20;

Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth. Potential to grow through increased employment, diversified income providing great growth opportunities.&#x20;

Goal 13: Climate action. Mitigate climate impacts by utilizing BMP to maintain security of on-farm assets. Promote carbon farming activities as a solution to addressing and mitigating climate impacts.&#x20;

Co-Benefits (optional): please state if the project includes additional co-benefits not specified in the methodology**:**

Soil health&#x20;

Biomass production&#x20;

Biodiversity&#x20;

Animal Welfare&#x20;

Further Information:&#x20;

n/a&#x20;

Monitoring For baseline measurements, please provide the monitoring information using the Monitoring Information template. Note, this same template will be used during each monitoring round throughout the Crediting Term.&#x20;

Compliance&#x20;

Compliance with laws and statues and other regulatory frameworks: Farm A complies with all relevant local, regional and national laws, statutes, and regulatory frameworks.

Participation in other GHG Programs: The Farm previously completed the registration process for Registry B. The Farm will be withdrawn from Registry B in the event that Regen Registry CarbonPlus Grasslands credits are issued and sold.

Emission Trading programs: Not at this time.

Other Forms of Environmental Credits: Farm A is registering with Registry C to accrue biodiversity credits for on-farm biodiversity. In the event that Regen Registry CarbonPlus Grasslands credits are issued and sold, the land subject to the issued and sold credits will be withdrawn from the biodiversity credit program.

Appendix Use the appendix for supporting information as needed.
