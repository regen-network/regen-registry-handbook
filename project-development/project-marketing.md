# Project Marketing

Regen Registry offers support for co-marketing and sales initiatives related to developed credits. To effectively carry out these activities, it is required for project developers to create a project page. The project page encompasses various project elements, including the project name, short and long-form project descriptions, developer information, and media resources such as photos, videos, and logos.&#x20;

Our team utilizes this information to generate marketing assets, such as a dedicated project webpage on [Regen Marketplace](https://app.regen.network). We also encourage the further development of collaborative co-marketing campaigns to support credit sales, depending on availability.&#x20;
