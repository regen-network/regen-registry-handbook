# Project Development Overview

During the project term, changes in ecological state are monitored to track how successfully the methodology was implemented and calculate the number of credits eligible to be sold in the market.&#x20;

Project development is intended (but not limited to) the following scenarios:

* A methodology developer has developed an approved methodology or has approval to use one from another registry and is ready to develop project(s)on Regen Registry&#x20;
* A project developer/Earth steward is using an approved methodology from the Regen Registry [Methodology Library ](https://library.regen.network/v/methodology-library/)to develop a project.\


Regen Registry registers new projects that implement approved methodologies and credit classes from Regen Registry [Methodology Library](https://library.regen.network/v/methodology-library/) or that have been approved from use from other registries.

Once a methodology and credit class are selected, project developers and/or Earth stewards can register a project and create credits.  The credits are registered on [Regen Ledger](https://docs.regen.network/).&#x20;

Regen Registry provides support to project developers and Earth stewards throughout the project development process with the following: templates, documentation reviews and open source science tools. The Regen Registry and Science teams rely on activating Regen Network community members, such as monitoring service providers, to support in the success of projects on the Regen Registry.
