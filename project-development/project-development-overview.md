# Project Development Overview

During the project term, changes in ecological state are monitored to track how successful the project was implemented and calculate the number of credits eligible to be sold in the market.&#x20;

The process of project development is intended (but not limited to) the following scenarios:

* You are a methodology developer that has developed an approved methodology and are ready to develop project(s) on Regen Registry&#x20;
* You are project developer using an approved methodology from the Regen Registry [Methodology Library ](https://library.regen.network/v/methodology-library/)
* You are an Earth steward interested in developing your own eco-credit project using an approved methodology from the Regen Registry [Methodology Library ](https://library.regen.network/v/methodology-library/)\


The indicators and metrics used for a project are stipulated in the approved methodology. The eligibility criteria and compliance are stipulated in the credit class. Regen Registry registers new projects that implement approved methodologies and credit classes from Regen Registry [Methodology Library](https://library.regen.network/v/methodology-library/).

Once a methodology and credit class fit are made, project developers and/or Earth stewards can register a project and create credits that live on [Regen Ledger](https://docs.regen.network/).&#x20;

Regen Registry provides support to project developers and Earth stewards throughout the project development process with the following: templates, documentation reviews and open source science tools. The Regen Registry and Science teams also rely on activating Regen Network community members, such as monitoring service providers, to support in the success of projects on the Regen Registry.
