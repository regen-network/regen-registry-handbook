# Project Development Overview

During the project term, changes in ecological state are monitored to track how successfully the methodology was implemented and calculate the number of credits eligible to be sold in the market.&#x20;

Projects can be developed by methodology developers, project developers or Earth stewards using methodologies and credit classes from the following:&#x20;

* [Regen Registry Library](https://library.regen.network)&#x20;
* Methodologies with approval to use from [another registry](../methodology-development/submitting-a-methodology.md)
* Explore [creating your own methodology](../methodology-development/methodology-development-overview.md) and [credit class ](broken-reference)\


Once a methodology and credit class are selected, project developers and/or Earth stewards can register a project and create credits.  The credits are listed on [Regen Ledger](https://docs.regen.network/).&#x20;

Regen Registry provides support to project developers and Earth stewards throughout the project development process with the following: templates, documentation reviews and open source science tools. The Regen Registry and Science teams rely on activating Regen Network community members, such as monitoring service providers, to support in the success of projects on the Regen Registry.
