# Project Development Overview

Projects are developed by methodology developers, project developers or Earth stewards using methodologies and credit classes from the following:&#x20;

* [Regen Registry Library](https://library.regen.network)&#x20;
* Methodologies with approval to use from [another registry](../methodology-development/submitting-a-methodology.md)
* [Your own methodology](../methodology-development/methodology-development-overview.md) and [credit class ](broken-reference)

During the project term, changes in ecological state are monitored to track how successfully the methodology was implemented and calculate the number of credits eligible to be sold in the market.&#x20;

## Project Development Process

* [Project Registration](project-registration/)
  * [Project plan submission](project-plan-template/)
  * Project validation
  * Project verification
* [Project Marketing](project-marketing.md)
  * [Project page](project-marketing/project-page-template.md)&#x20;
* [Credit Issuance ](credit-issuance.md)
  * Project lifecycle



Once the data is verified credits can be created to list in on [Regen Ledger](https://docs.regen.network/) and sell through the [Regen Marketplace](https://app.regen.network/)

Regen Registry provides support to project developers and Earth stewards throughout the project development process with the following: templates, documentation reviews and open source science tools. The Regen Registry and Science teams rely on activating Regen Network community members, such as monitoring service providers, to support in the success of projects on the Regen Registry.
