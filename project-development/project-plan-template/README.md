# Project Plan Template

The Project Plan should be filled out only after the Project Proponent has reviewed the relevant material to the project at hand, including the Guide, the corresponding Credit Class, Methodology, and all pertinent information on the Regen Registry website, and have concluded there is a fit to their needs. For further clarifications please send an email to support-registry@regen.network.

Note if there are duplicate requirements between this template and the Credit Class, the latter supersedes.
