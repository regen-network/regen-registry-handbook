# Versioning

The Regen Registry Program Guide updated editions are labeled with a version number.  Version 2.0 is the second working version of the Regen Registry Program Guide.  Version 2.0 is composed of program documents labeled v2.x, where x is a running number starting at 0.  Individual documents may be updated from time to time as needed and versions numbers will be updated accordingly.  Where documents are updated, an appendix to the document will clearly state the updates made and their effective date.  Readers shall ensure that they are using the most current version of this and all other program documents.  New versions of the Regen Registry Program Guide will be issued on a periodic basis when major edition updates are required. New/subsequent versions of the Program Guide will be posted on the RND website for public comment for 30 days prior to adoption. Regen Registry will prepare responses to submitted comments and post the comments and responses along with the new version of the Program Guide.
