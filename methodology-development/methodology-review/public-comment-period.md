# Public Comment Period

Public comment is a period after internal review and before scientific review when the community at large -- scientists, economists, producers, stewards, investors, etc. -- have the opportunity to review your methodology and suggest changes. This process allows the community to actively participate in the development process, aligning with Regen Network’s mission of fostering an open source community..

**Who Can Participate in the Public Comment Process?**&#x20;

Anyone can submit comments through the Feedback Document. Someone submitting a comment will state their role along with their comment.&#x20;

* <mark style="color:orange;">Steps for Public Comment (as a Community Member)</mark>&#x20;
  * Where do they look for the methods?&#x20;
  * How do I provide comments?&#x20;
  * What should I comment on?&#x20;
  * How long do I have to provide comments?&#x20;
  * Will I get any compensation for peer reviewing? → Probably depend on the activity and the method. Maybe to advertise or review

**The Process for Methodology Developer (4-5 Weeks)**&#x20;

* Your methodology will be posted on RND’s website and publicly announced through various networks and social mediums. Comments are accepted for a minimum 30 day period. As the methodology developer, you can expect a range of comments.&#x20;
* All comments and feedback compiled in Feedback Document (template need will be sent to the Methodology Developer.&#x20;
* The Methodology Developer must compile a Revision Report (template need) which must address each comment/revision request with a written response falling into one of the following categories:
  * Written response to individual question or inquiry
  * An indication of how comments/revision requests were incorporated into the upgraded version
  * An explanation of why comments/revision requests were not incorporated into the upgraded version&#x20;
* Methodology Developer submits Revision Report to Regen Registry with two of the following outcomes:&#x20;
  * Regen Registry confirms Revision Report completes the requirements. Revision Report posted alongside the beta methodology, publicly available <mark style="color:orange;">(template needed)</mark>
  * Regen Registry rejects the methodology and provides full evaluation documentation<mark style="color:orange;">(template needed)</mark>

_Certain methodologies may need to go through a more rigorous scientific review process before the methodology is accepted._

<mark style="color:orange;">Questions that need resolution: Do they need to write anything summarizing their method to prepare for community peer review? How long does the developer have to respond? What happens if there are no comments? How will comments be submitted? Via a form? The methodology itself? Does the methodology developer need to respond to all the comments and incorporate all the changes? Who decides which comments need to be addressed?</mark>
