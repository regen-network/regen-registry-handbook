# Scientific Peer Review

**What Is A Scientific Peer Review?**

The overarching goal of peer review is to evaluate proposed methods and validate claims before it is published and used. Peer review also creates connections around innovative ideas and drives research forward.

Peer review methods are used to maintain quality standards, improve performance, and provide credibility. Peer review ensures that new research is original and uses valid science through the evaluation of the work by one or more people with expert knowledge in the field of the work. It functions as a form of self-regulation by qualified members of a profession within the relevant field.

Peer review allows the scientific community to continuously put out high-quality information, methods and processes that practitioners, and researchers can trust. In the ecosystem services market, the peer review process ensures that the methodology proposed can be utilized to deliver proposed results, whether that is a GHG result or an ecosystem benefit.

**Why A Scientific Peer Review Is Important**

The peer review process provides valuable feedback for those developing methodologies.  It is a method of verification that is widely respected and understood and creates value for your project.  Overall the process works to advance the field of Nature Based Solutions (NBS) by helping to create verified standards that elevate the importance of NBS.

**Why it is Important for Scientists to Engage in Peer Reviews**

Reviewers benefit by exposure to the latest developments in their fields, facilitating their keeping up-to-date with the latest publications. Tenure committees look favorably on participation in peer review, and invitations to review underscore that the reviewer is a respected subject matter expert. Contacts made during the peer review process can lead to long-lasting collaboration.

Early career researchers (ECRs) could and should also become involved in peer review. Becoming a reviewer early in your career helps you to better appreciate the feedback you receive as an author. A further benefit is it provides training in evaluating research critically. Are their methods suitable? Have they analyzed and interpreted the results correctly? Do their conclusions seem valid and appropriate for the data presented? There is a clear reason for ECRs to become reviewers from a personal perspective, but the academic community benefits more widely. ECRs form a significant component of the academic community, and their involvement in peer review spreads out the workload, resulting in a more efficient process. Furthermore, increased participation prevents single individuals having too much influence over what theories or approaches are accepted or rejected.

Steps for Peer Review (Regen Registry)

* Steps for Scientific Peer Review (as a scientific Member) What kinds of comments should I review? Do I review the entire method or just sections? How do I provide comments? What should I comment on? How long do I have to provide comments? Will I get any compensation for peer reviewing? â†’ Probably depend on the activity and the method. Maybe to advertise or review How will my participation be made public?
