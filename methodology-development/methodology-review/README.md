# Methodology Review

Each project has the option to engage in our Public Comment Period and Scientific Peer Review Process.  These reviews are optional, the benefit of engaging in reviews is in promoting scientific transparency and instilling buyer assurance and confidence in claims.  This process is in place to promote best practices in MRV and foster both innovation and trust. Check out our [Methodology Review Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12YzGNI-kQwT82keMR9mr7BdisLUpNN9O6H4H\_dMlox4/edit?usp=sharing) to see how the science community can support the further development of your methods.
