# Regen Registry Methodology Review Process

## Methodology Review Process

The methodology review process consists of four stages before it is published on the Regen Registry:&#x20;

1. Informal feedback from Regen Registry and the community&#x20;
2. Internal review
3. Expert peer review
4. Public comment&#x20;

Each of these stages are described below.

### Informal Feedback from Regen Registry & the Community

In order to implement an effective and efficient review process we encourage methodology developers to submit high quality methodologies for review. As a methodology is being developed it will likely be helpful to seek informal feedback from the Regen Network Science and Regen Registry teams and other community members with expertise and knowledge of the methods you are proposing. This feedback will help ensure the methodology being submitted for the review process is well written and the methodology framework is robust.

### Internal Review

The first formal step in the review process after a methodology developer submits a methodology to the Regen Registry Methodology Review Lead, is an internal review by Regen Registry. The intent of the internal review is to ensure that the methodology adheres to the requirements outlined in this Program Guide and that the quality of the methodology framework is sufficient to warrant review by our peers in the scientific community. We will also verify that three or more suitable potential reviewers have been submitted with the methodology to assist with the selection of expert peer reviewers.

The Methodology Review Lead will review the methodology, drawing on outside expertise if necessary, to determine if it is complete and of suitable quality (language and content) for expert review. Regen Registry aims to complete the internal review in less than two weeks. The methodology will be returned to methodology developers to inform them whether or not the methodology is potentially suitable to be hosted on the Regen Registry and if it is, provide feedback on how to improve it. At the discretion of the Methodology Review Lead, the methodology will proceed to the expert peer review stage.

### Expert Peer Review

The expert peer review will focus on ensuring that the proposed methodology is scientifically robust and likely to produce the expected results using the methods outlined in the methodology. To accomplish this, we will enlist the help of a minimum of two peers from the expert community that have sufficient expertise to evaluate the proposed methods. We will use the list of potential expert peer reviewers submitted with the methodology and will identify additional reviewers at the discretion of the Methodology Review Lead. This selection process can take a few weeks to accomplish. More information about the process that reviewers will follow can be found in the “Peer reviewer guidelines” section below. When the Methodology Review Lead is satisfied that the methodology is acceptable the methodology developer will be notified and the final review phase, the public review process, can begin.

#### Handling a Review

All steps of the expert peer review will be managed by the Methodology Review Lead. When the number of methodologies being submitted increases beyond the capacity that can be effectively handled internal Regen Registry Review Leads, Regen Registry will solicit, through a public announcement, additional methodology review handlers. The additional handlers would work under the direction of the lead and be responsible for identifying and coordinating recommendations to the Methodology Review Lead. When using additional review handlers, Regen Registry will aim to engage with individuals that represent a broad range of expertise so methodologies can be sent to handlers based on how familiar they are with the methods being used. All final decisions will be made by the Methodology Review Lead.

#### Anonymity&#x20;

We will be using a single-blind review process where the names of the methodology developers are known but the reviewers have the option of being named in the review. The default option is that reviewers remain anonymous. We are using this approach initially since it will make it easier to find reviewers. After the review process is more mature and we have built a reputation for producing high quality methodologies, we will consider changing to an open review process.

#### Review

Once a reviewer accepts to review a methodology they will have three weeks to provide feedback. In some cases more time will be allotted to accommodate reviewer scheduling constraints. In addition to feedback on the methodology, reviewers will also make one of the following recommendations: accept as is, request changes (minor or major), reject and resubmit, or reject.

When the Methodology Review Lead receives comments from reviewers they will assess the proposed comments and a final decision will be made to accept the methodology as is, request changes (minor or major), reject and resubmit the methodology, or reject the methodology. If necessary, the Methodology Review Lead will request additional feedback to clarify reviewer feedback that is not clear or is contradictory. The decision along with feedback from the reviewers and the Methodology Review Lead will then be sent to the methodology developer.

#### Revisions

If revisions are requested, the methodology developers will have a maximum of six weeks to address reviewer feedback and resubmit a revised methodology along with clear notification of changes that were made with explicit note of responses to reviewer feedback. When the RND methodology review lead receives a revised methodology, they will decide if it needs to go out for a second (or more) round of expert peer review. If it goes out for review again, an effort will be made to use the same reviewers (if they formerly accepted to review future versions) or new reviewers will need to be found. If new reviewers are used, they will be made aware this is a revised methodology and they will need to have access to the revisions and past comments.

#### Expert Peer Reviewer Guidelines

The task of a reviewer is to provide critical feedback to the methodology developer to help them improve the methodology. The reviewer should consider themselves an ally of the methodology developers.

The Methodology Review Lead will contact potential reviewers until a minimum of two people commit to review the methodology. When a potential peer reviewer is contacted they will be offered a stipend between $100 and $300 to complete a review, depending on the complexity of the methodology, at the discretion of the Methodology Review Lead. The range of stipends might be adjusted as the peer review program matures. When contacted, potential reviewers will have one week to accept or decline the offer to review. If there is no response, a follow-up letter will be sent to the potential reviewer. If no response or a negative response is received, then a search for another reviewer will begin. If a potential reviewer declines to review they will be requested to provide one or more alternates.

If a review cannot be submitted within the three week time period, the reviewer should contact the RND methodology review lead as early as possible to request an extension. Extensions will be granted at the discretion of the Methodology Review Lead.

The review should provide feedback on the validity of the methodology. Specifically it should address the following:

* Is the methodology clearly written with adequate detail for implementation?&#x20;
* Is the underlying foundation of the methodology clear?&#x20;
* Is the Methodology feasible?&#x20;
* Will the proposed methods achieve the results defined in the methodology?&#x20;
* Are the sampling and measurement protocols robust?&#x20;
* Are there alternative or additional steps that should be considered?&#x20;
* Any additional questions noted by the methodology review lead

In addition to review comments, the reviewer should also indicate if they are willing to review a future version of the methodology and if they want to be named in the review.

### Public Comment

After a methodology has successfully completed the expert peer review process it will advance to the final review stage, public comment. Comments about the methodology will be solicited from the general public for a period of two weeks. The public commenting period will be announced using RND’s typical social media platforms including the RNDs Discord server and Twitter.

Public comments can be made and discussed in the Methodology Public Comment channel on RND’s Discord server or they can be sent directly to the Methodology Review Lead. Any comments made on Discord will be identifiable by the handle of the person making the comments. People submitting comments directly to the Methodology Review Lead will have the option to remain anonymous (the default option) or they can request to have their name attached to the comments.

The Discord Methodology Public Comment channel can be used for the public to openly and informally discuss the methodology. Methodology developers are encouraged to monitor this Discord channel during the public comment period and engage with the public as comments and questions are posted.

Initially, we will not provide a specific format for public comments but they should be constructive and developed with the intent of improving the methodology and in the spirit of an ally with the methodology developer. The points noted in the “Peer reviewer guidelines” section can be used to guide the types of comments we are looking for.

After the two week comment period, the RND methodology review lead will compile comments and synthesize them before sending them to the methodology developer. If there are major concerns that cannot be confidently resolved within RND, expert input from the expert community will be requested. Also, some clarification might be requested from the commenters when necessary by the Methodology Review Lead.

The methodology developer will have six weeks to respond to the synthesized comments and return the revised methodology, along with responses to feedback, to the RND methodology review lead. The RND methodology review lead will review the revised methodology and will decide if the methodology is sufficient to be used on the Regen Ledger or if more work is required. If more work is required, the RND methodology review lead will request the methodology developer to make specific changes to the methodology. When, at the discretion of the RND Methodology Review Lead, the methodology is of sufficient quality, the review process will end and the methodology will become integrated on the Regen Ledger.
