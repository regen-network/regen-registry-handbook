# Submitting a Methodology

### Where to Start

It might seem like an overwhelming process, but we’re here to help! Prior to developing a methodology, take a look to see if there is a similar methodology that is already approved on our program or other accepted programs either from our [Methodology Library](http://library.regen.network) or from various third party programs such as:

* Gold Standard
* American Carbon Registry
* Climate Action Reserve
* Australian Emission Reduction Fund - Carbon Farming Initiative
* Social Carbon Registry
* Plan Vivo Registry
* Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) Registry
* Climate, Carbon, & Biodiversity Standards (CCBS) Registry

If you plan to use a methodology from another existing registry program and would like to consider adding to this list, please contact us at registry@regen.network.

At this time, Regen Registry requires all parties to review and sign the [Regen Registry Terms of Service](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGvPI5NjsS4WhMCL3AyRa0oHP6j2R34YByNVRo8XDkA/edit#heading=h.ew69mclrluk) to legally engage with and fully understand definitions, contracts and processes of working with Regen Registry. If you plan on submitting a methodology to the Regen Registry program, please review our terms of service and our team will contact you upon submission. Please contact registry@regen.network with any questions.

### Submitting a Fully Developed Methodology

To submit a methodology that has already gone through a peer review process, or exists on another registry, please submit through our [Methodology Intake Form](https://airtable.com/appzrw40tJdLBM2RS/shrLCL7ioWuGLSc7g). Your methodology will be reviewed by our Registry and Science Teams and we will get back to you with next steps.

### Submitting a New Methodology

#### Submit a Concept Note

A concept note is a short proposal of an idea for a project or methodology. If you are a researcher or project developer with an idea for a methodology, whether for monitoring a particular ecosystem change or an approach to address environmental and societal challenges, a concept note is a good starting point to get your thoughts on paper. Ideas can range from a fully developed concept note to a rough draft.

Use the [Concept Note Submission Form](https://airtable.com/shrunsKASd5BDfI0N) to submit a concept note. Upon submission, our team will review and respond within 3 weeks to approve or suggest edits required for approval.

#### Submit Your Methodology

​​Your methodology draft should outline standards and tools to monitor the ecological, environmental, and social indicators covered by your nature-based solution. Your approach can be region specific or cover a wide range of locations.

At this time, if you plan to register a new methodology with Regen Registry, we require that you go through the expert peer review and a two-week public comment period to register a methodology with the Regen Registry. We are working on options for a permissionless processes.

When you are ready to submit, use the [Methodology Intake Form](https://airtable.com/appzrw40tJdLBM2RS/shrLCL7ioWuGLSc7g) to submit a methodology draft for internal review.

For more information on methodology submission requirements and the continued development process please read the [Methodology Developments Overview](methodology-development-overview.md) chapter.
