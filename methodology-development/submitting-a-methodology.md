# Submitting a Methodology

### Where to Start

A lot can go into writing a new methodology and it might seem like an overwhelming process, but we’re here to help! The Regen Registry recognizes the great work of other Registry Programs. Prior to developing a methodology, take a look to see if there is a similar methodology that is already approved on our program or other accepted programs either from our [Methodology Library](http://library.regen.network) or from our list of approved third party programs:

* Gold Standard&#x20;
* American Carbon Registry&#x20;
* Climate Action Reserve&#x20;
* Australian Emission Reduction Fund - Carbon Farming Initiative&#x20;
* Social Carbon Registry&#x20;
* Plan Vivo Registry&#x20;
* Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) Registry&#x20;
* Climate, Carbon, & Biodiversity Standards (CCBS) Registry

If you plan to use a methodology from an existing registry program and would like to consider adding to this list, please contact us at registry@regen.network.

At this time, Regen Registry requires all parties to review and sign the [Regen Registry Terms of Service](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGvPI5NjsS4WhMCL3AyRa0oHP6j2R34YByNVRo8XDkA/edit#heading=h.ew69mclrluk) to legally engage with and fully understand definitions, contracts and processes of working with Regen Registry. If you plan on submitting a methodology to the Regen Registry program, please review our Terms of Service and our team will contact you upon submission. Please contact registry@regen.network with any questions.&#x20;

### Submitting a Fully Developed Methodology

To submit a methodology that has already gone through a peer review process, or exists on another registry, please submit through our [Methodology Intake Form](https://airtable.com/shrLCL7ioWuGLSc7g). Your methodology will undergo Regen Network’s Methodology Review Process and our science team will get back to you with next steps

### Submitting a New Methodology

#### Submit a Concept Note

A Concept Note is a short proposal of an idea for a project or methodology. If you are a researcher or project developer with an idea for a methodology, whether for monitoring a particular ecosystem change or an approach to address environmental and societal challenges, a concept note is a good starting point to get your thoughts on paper. Ideas can range from a fully developed concept note to a rough draft.&#x20;

Use the [Concept Note Submission Form](https://airtable.com/shrunsKASd5BDfI0N) to submit a concept note. Upon submission, our team will review and respond within 2 weeks to approve or suggest edits required for approval.

#### Submit Your Methodology

​​Your methodology draft should aim to outline standards and tools to monitor the ecological, environmental, and social indicators covered by your nature-based solution. Your approach can be region specific or cover a wide range of locations.

At this time, if you plan to register a new methodology with Regen Registry, we require that you go through the Expert Peer Review and a two-week Public Comment period to register methodology with the Regen Registry.  We are working on options for potentially less rigorous review processes.

When you are ready to submit, use the [Methodology Intake Form](https://airtable.com/shrLCL7ioWuGLSc7g) to submit a methodology draft for Internal Review.

For more information on methodology submission requirements and the continued development process go to the Methodology Developments Process chapter.
