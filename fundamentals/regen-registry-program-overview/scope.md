# Scope

Regen Registry focuses exclusively on nature based solutions. Financial mechanisms aim to incentivize activities that protect, sustainably and/or regeneratively manage, restore natural or modified ecosystems, address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. Other activities, for instance focused on sustainable energy or energy savings, transportation, industrial process, construction, mining and industrial waste management, while undoubtedly important, are not the current focus of our program.
