Regen Registry aims to maximize flexibility and usability for Project Proponents while maintaining the environmental integrity, transparency and scientific rigor necessary to ensure that projects developed against its credit classes and methodologies are of the highest quality.  **  **<mark style="color:orange;">**We differ from other registry programs in that we are community led.  Our registry is open source, edited and maintained by our community with the registry merely acting as a basecamp and network for community members to communicate, organize, and grow.**</mark>\

**Regen Registry** is a voluntary ecosystem services marketplace designed with farmers, land stewards and project developers that features a suite of program tools that allow communities to develop methodologies and assets that quantify measurable ecological outcomes, and directly address climate change. The Regen Registry is a third-party standard and certification system for climate, agriculture, and development actions that provide comprehensive oversight, certification and regulation of Projects and the issuance or generation of Products.

The **Regen Registry Program** aims provide an open source, vertically integrated solution including:

* Providing the infrastructure and frameworks for community members to connect and collaborate on methodology development, project development, monitoring, and credit design.
* Marketing platform - showcases the unique story of each project, highlighting the land stewards, the impact on the land, environment, and co-benefits; provides buyers and policy makers with impact analytics on a portfolio (regional, national, and global) of key ecological indicators.
* Marketplace and exchange (trading platform) - sellers offer their credits for sale; buyers purchase from one or multiple projects and build a portfolio; the system provides a clearing and settlement infrastructure including payments and billing.
* Regen Ledger - a custom-built ecological ledger using blockchain technology where credits are issued and transferred, and monitoring and verification claims are recorded as immutable records.
* Each layer offered within the Regen Registry is standalone and Project Proponents can choose which ones to use.
