# About Regen Registry

[Regen Registry](https://registry.regen.network) is an emerging ecosystem services registry program operating in the voluntary market that aims to support climate action and sustainable development by accelerating the adoption of nature-based solutions which regenerate and restore natural ecosystems. Regen Registry maximizes accessibility to payment for ecosystem service markets by reducing project development costs and streamlining the Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) processes to increase revenues for land stewards, while maintaining the environmental integrity and scientific rigor necessary to ensure projects developed against its credit classes and methodologies are of the highest quality.

Regen Registry is involved in both the design and evaluation of robust ecosystem service credits and methodologies. The Regen Registry Program Guide outlines the processes and frameworks by which different stakeholders can engage in the creation, development, and verification of ecological assets and how methodology development should aim to set standards and develop tools that enable transparent monitoring of environmental health and support social impacts in a sustainable way.

In addition to outlining the standards by which credits should be created and reviewed, Regen Registry supports methodology and project developers by providing resources which will aid in the design and evaluation of new methodologies ([<mark style="color:orange;">Creating a Methodology</mark>](https://regen-registry.s3.amazonaws.com/process-for-creating-a-methodology.pdf), [Methodology Peer Review Process](https://registry.regen.network/methodology-review-process), and [Nature Based Solution Framework Methodology](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/1ccQRkhc5fDv1qTtlh7EEJ6eZsJ4IqtbU0Cwd\_lwiI5A/edit)) and help get projects off the ground ([Project Bases for CarbonPlus Grasslands](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zfRclxWGtJ46cz9bQoCVtcKd-PLAoSXyiIgUeRN-PPA/edit) and [CarbonPlus FAQs](https://www.regen.network/faq/carbonplus%20credits)).
