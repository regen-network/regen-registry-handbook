# Modifications to Approved Credit Protocols

The credit protocol admin may permit modifications to an existing approved credit protocol where they maintain the guidelines stipulated in the Regen Registry Guide. Credit protocol modifications may be submitted for review by Regen Registry. Regen Registry will review the extent of the modification and determine what steps in the approval process above need to be implemented.
